## Arduino Supplies

## Python plan

### Ideal Model
Using pysolar

P = Solar Irradiance

$$P = c * PI$$, where P = { V, I } and c is conversion rate

P = V  * I vector

V is constant

### Non-ideal using meteorological data (NOAA)
P(t) = { E/V/I } For t-40 years.

#### pros
* Get more realistic data (cloud cover/weather conditions)

#### cons
* Way more noise (We can take the average or do ML to get more trends etc.)

### Using date collected from solar panels
t = { take data for a few months at hourly rates }

Run the data through ML to get trends etc. (Maybe predict)

validate our equipment on the efficiency C = P/P(I)

Average using rms?

## Main Objective for next week
### python team meeting
Nov 17th @ 5:00pm
Location: TBD
* Look at "pysolar" documentation
* see if pysolar or solarpy is better (Or third option?)

### Arduino
Order supplies
